If you would like to contribute to the LINC documentation and render the documentation locally as you make edits, please follow the steps below:

1. Fork the [linc-docs repository](https://github.com/lincbrain/linc-docs) and clone it to your computer.
2. Set up a Python environment with the dependencies in the [requirements.txt file](https://github.com/lincbrain/linc-docs/blob/main/requirements.txt).
